# Exploring Star Types through Logistic Regression

Welcome to the **Exploring Star Types through Logistic Regression** project! This project focuses on using logistic regression to classify stars into different types based on various features. In this readme file, we will cover all the important details about the project, including the libraries used, the dataset, the methodology, and the code snippets to help you understand and replicate the project.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- **NumPy (np)**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on these structures efficiently.

- **Pandas (pd)**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames to efficiently handle structured data.

- **scikit-learn**: A popular machine learning library in Python. We specifically used the following modules from scikit-learn:

  - **train_test_split**: Used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
  - **KFold**: Used for cross-validation during model evaluation.
  
  - **StandardScaler**: Used for standardizing the features to have mean 0 and variance 1.
  
  - **LogisticRegression**: The logistic regression model used for star type classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named **6 class csv.csv**. This dataset likely contains features related to stars that we will use to predict their types. Please make sure you have this dataset in the same directory as the code to run the project successfully.

## Methodology

1. **Import Libraries**: The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the code to ensure smooth execution.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas to prepare it for exploration and modeling.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature selection, and standardization using the StandardScaler.

4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

5. **Model Creation and Training**: A logistic regression model is created and trained on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, and cross-validation is performed using KFold to ensure robustness.

7. **Results and Conclusion**: The project's findings and conclusions are discussed based on the model's performance and the insights gained from exploring the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project explores star types using logistic regression, aiming to classify stars based on the provided dataset. By following the code snippets and understanding the methodology, you can replicate the project and gain insights into star type classification. Experiment with different evaluation metrics and explore the dataset further to enhance your understanding.
